## Install OpenSSH client
The OpenSSH .msi Windows Installer file by default installs both ssh Server and Client. We only want to install the client, the command line option is ADDLOCAL=Client. By default, msiexec.exe doesn’t add the installation path to your system’s $env:path environment variable. For this, add ADD_PATH=1 to the command. This makes the full command to install OpenSSH Client on your system:
Execute in an elevated PowerShell window
```
Start-Process -NoNewWindow msiexec.exe  -ArgumentList "/i <full path to msi installer> ADDLOCAL=Client ADD_PATH=1" -Wait
```


## List and add keys to SSH agent

```
